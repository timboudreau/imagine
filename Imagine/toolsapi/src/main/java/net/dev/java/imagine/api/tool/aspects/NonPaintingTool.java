 * Here the plumbing sticks up through the floor a bit.  This is a marker
 * interface which indicates a tool will not actually try to modify the 
 * graphics context of the image - in other words, the tool is something like
 * a move tool for dragging the layer around, etc.  
 * <p>
 * The reason for its existence is basically to notify the object being
 * modified how it should back itself up for undo purposes;  the alternative
 * is poor performance.
