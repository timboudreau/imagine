 * Useful for modal tools in which the user edits and then performs some
 * gesture to commit the edit, such as a tool that draws connected lines
 * by individual clicks and ends a series of lines with a double click
 * or enter keystroke to indicate that the edited image should really
 * be updated;  up to that point the paint() method will be called only
 * to draw on top of the surface of the designer, not to really draw
 * into the backing image.
