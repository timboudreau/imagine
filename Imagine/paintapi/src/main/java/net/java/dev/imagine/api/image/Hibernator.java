 * is not likely to be painted for some time.  Implementations may do such
 * things as store raster data in slower but more memory-efficient forms or
 * off the Java heap.
 * <p>
 * This is typically done for Layer objects which are being placed on an 
 * undo stack and will most likely never be touched again (they have been
 * deleted;  if an undo operation is slow, that's better than running out
 * of memory).  It may also be done for images which are not currently visible
 * on screen if the system is low on memory.
