/**
 * This class serves to give us a persistent selection context;  NetBeans'
 * default context sensitivity is very aggressive - selection depends 
 * completely on what component has focus.  
 * <p>
 * Our application is one where components <i>combine</i> context - the
 * selected tool along with the current image editor, etc.  So this class
 * gives us a lookup which merges the default, component-sensitive lookup
 * with other, more persistent lookups, to form a unified "selection context" 
 * for the application.
 * <p>
 * So what really will be in this lookup?  Well, it proxies 
 * Utilities.actionsGlobalContext, so anything a TopComponent (top level
 * component in a tab in the main window) will be there when that component
 * is focused.
 * <p>
 * In addition to this, several pieces of infrastructure will merge their
 * own Lookups into this one - for example, when the selected tool changes,
 * because the user selected a menu item or pressed a button provided by
 * the ToolsUI module, whatever Tool the user selected will appear, and the
 * previously selected Tool, if any, will disappear.  So any UI that is 
 * interested in what tool is active needs to simply listen for changes in
 * the presence or absence of Tool.class:
 * <pre>
 * Lookup.Result result = ApplicationContext.get (new Lookup.Template(Tool.class));
 * result.addLookupListener (...)
 * </pre>
 * and it will be notified whenever the active tool changes.
 * <p>
 * What generally can you expect to find here?
 * <ul>
 * <li>Picture.class - the layers object of the active editor, if any </li>
 * <li>Layer.class - the active layer of the active editor, if any </li>
 * <li>IO.class - the object for saving/reloading the image in the active editor</li>
 * <li>Zoom.class - the object for adjusting the zoom of the active editor</li>
 * <li>UndoRedo.Manager - a NetBeans subclass of UndoManager which supports
 *    listening for undoable edits being added/removed</li>
 * <li>PaintTopComponent.class - this class is not visible outside the 
 *    PaintUI module, but some actions it itself provides use it directly
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2>How to merger other Lookups into the Application Context</h2>
 * The ApplicationContext is composed of a set of lookups, including
 * Utilities.actionsGlobalContext().  To merge your own lookup into this,
 * implement Lookup.Provider and put an instance of your Lookup.Provider in
 * the default Lookup by adding a file to META-INF/services in your module
 * jar.
