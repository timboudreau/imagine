Imagine
=======

The Imagine image editor project was developed in 2005 as a NetBeans platform application demo which
featured a robust modular architecture for effects, brushes and other painting tools - sort of a
photoshop-in-Java applications.  It was hosted on kenai.com until that site was shut down by Oracle in
2017, so it lives on here.

I'm hoping to find a backup of it's original web content from java.net to put up here.

In the meantime, it should work and is buildable with Maven.
